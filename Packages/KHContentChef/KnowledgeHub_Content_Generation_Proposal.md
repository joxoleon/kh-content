# KnowledgeHub Content Generation Ecosystem Proposal

This proposal focuses on building a robust **content generation ecosystem** for KnowledgeHub, emphasizing services, data structures, and workflows as the core components. The CLI serves only as an interface to these functionalities, while the primary focus is on modular, testable, and flexible architecture.

---

## Core Vision: Modular Content Generation Ecosystem

The goal is to develop a system that supports flexible workflows for generating lessons, topics, and courses. It should:
1. Enable **modular workflows** for different levels of content generation.
2. Be **data-driven**, relying on structured inputs and outputs (e.g., JSON).
3. Allow **manual intervention** at key points for refining AI-generated content.
4. Ensure **testability and extensibility** through decoupled components.

---

## Key Components

### 1. **Content Services**
Specialized services handle distinct aspects of content generation and validation:

#### a. **Lesson Generation Service**
- **Purpose:** Generate individual lessons based on a templated prompt.
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Accept a title and description as input.
  - Generate the lesson using the OpenAI API.
  - Validate the output to ensure required fields are present.
  - Save the lesson to a structured JSON file.

#### b. **Topic Metadata Generation Service**
- **Purpose:** Generate a structured topic with metadata for multiple lessons.
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Take a high-level topic description as input.
  - Generate an array of lesson metadata (titles, descriptions).
  - Validate and save the metadata to a JSON/YAML file.

#### c. **Course Generation Service**
- **Purpose:** Generate a complete course by defining its topics and objectives.
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Accept a detailed course description as input.
  - Generate topic metadata for the course.
  - Save the course structure in a structured file format.

#### d. **Module Organization Service**
- **Purpose:** Organize generated lessons into in-app modules.
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Take lesson metadata as input.
  - Use AI to group lessons into logical modules.
  - Output a JSON representation of modules.

#### e. **Validation Service**
- **Purpose:** Validate outputs at every step of the pipeline.
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Ensure generated content adheres to predefined schemas.
  - Retry failed validations automatically where applicable.

### 2. **Data Structures**

#### a. **Lesson File**
- **Format:** JSON
- **Structure:**
  ```json
  {
    "title": "Understanding Combine Basics",
    "description": "An introduction to Apple's Combine framework.",
    "content": "Full lesson text here.",
    "summary": "Key takeaways here.",
    "quiz": [
      {"question": "What is Combine?", "options": ["A", "B", "C"], "answer": "A"}
    ]
  }
  ```

#### b. **Topic Metadata File**
- **Format:** JSON/YAML
- **Structure:**
  ```yaml
  title: "Combine Framework Essentials"
  description: "Everything you need to know about Combine."
  lessons:
    - title: "Introduction to Combine"
      description: "An overview of Combine and its purpose."
    - title: "Using Publishers and Subscribers"
      description: "How to work with Combineâ€™s core components."
  ```

#### c. **Course Metadata File**
- **Format:** JSON/YAML
- **Structure:**
  ```yaml
  title: "Mastering Combine Framework"
  description: "A comprehensive guide to using Combine in iOS development."
  topics:
    - title: "Combine Basics"
      description: "Introduction to the Combine framework."
    - title: "Advanced Combine"
      description: "Deep dive into advanced Combine concepts."
  ```

#### d. **Module File**
- **Format:** JSON
- **Structure:**
  ```json
  {
    "modules": [
      {
        "title": "Combine Basics",
        "lessons": ["Introduction to Combine", "Using Publishers and Subscribers"]
      },
      {
        "title": "Advanced Topics",
        "lessons": ["Custom Publishers", "Performance Tuning with Combine"]
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

### 3. **Workflow and Orchestration**
Each workflow represents a combination of services working together to achieve specific goals:

#### a. **Lesson Generation Workflow**
- Input: Lesson title and description (via a topic metadata file).
- Output: Validated lesson file (JSON).

#### b. **Topic Generation Workflow**
- Input: High-level topic description.
- Output: Topic metadata file (JSON/YAML).
- Notes: Includes retries for failed lesson generations and validation.

#### c. **Course Generation Workflow**
- Input: Detailed course description.
- Output: Course metadata file (JSON/YAML).
- Notes: Combines topics into a single course structure.

#### d. **Full Pipeline**
- Input: High-level course description.
- Output: Complete set of files (courses, topics, lessons, and modules).
- Notes: Supports pausing at key steps for review and intervention.

---

### 4. **Manual Intervention and Verification**
- **Flexible Review Points:** Allow users to edit topic files after generation or manually refine lessons before moving to the next step.
- **Customizable Pausing:** Users can pause the pipeline at specific stages to review progress.

---

### 5. **Extensibility and Testing**
- **Service Interfaces:** Each service exposes clear interfaces for unit and integration testing.
- **Mocked OpenAI API:** Enable local testing without requiring actual API calls.
- **Extensibility:** Easily add new features (e.g., video content generation) by integrating with the existing architecture.

---

## Summary

This approach emphasizes:
1. **Content Services:** Modular components for generating and validating lessons, topics, and courses.
2. **Structured Data:** Clear input/output formats to ensure consistency.
3. **Workflow Orchestration:** Streamlined pipelines that support both automation and manual intervention.
4. **Extensibility:** A flexible architecture that adapts to future needs.

The result is a cohesive system for generating, validating, and organizing content in KnowledgeHub.
