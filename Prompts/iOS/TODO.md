- [difficult] Add potential links to other lessons, maybe with lesson id's but this is something that might have to be done manually


# DONE

### Lesson prompts
- Estimated reading time - WILL DO WITH CONTENT programatically!
- Estimated difficulty level
- Update the id system, so that it uses the lowercased snakecase title as the id
- Create a module prompt that is going to organize the lessons into modules
- Provide the list of lesson titles for it (and it will turn the titles into ids)
- Use GPT to generate a proper prompt that is going to be used for this
- Integrate Module Parser
- Parse modules within the CLI tool and output according content files
