### Instructions:

1. **Output Format**:
   - **Generate the output as a single YAML file**.
   - Present the output in a code block so it’s ready to copy and use directly in a YAML-compatible editor.

2. **Structure and Organization**:
   - Think of this as a well-cataloged course outline with carefully grouped lessons.
   - **"Leaf" modules** (modules containing lessons without further submodules) should include **no more than 1-7 lessons**. If a topic requires more lessons, consider creating multiple modules in a logical, organized way.
   - **Depth of Modules**: Avoid deep nesting wherever possible. The maximum depth of modules should be 6 to maintain clarity and readability. 

3. **Considerations for Content Grouping**:
   - Carefully analyze each lesson’s **title** and **description** to determine the most suitable groupings.
   - If a module has too many lessons, look for opportunities to split it sensibly based on topic areas or levels of proficiency (e.g., Fundamental, Intermediate, Advanced).
   - Aim to maintain a logical flow from basic concepts to advanced topics wherever possible.

4. **Consistency in Module and Lesson Titles**:
   - Use clear and professional titles for both modules and lessons.
   - Ensure module titles accurately reflect the content scope, e.g., use terms like "Fundamentals" or "Advanced" if they help convey the learning path.
   
5. **Suggested Grouping Logic**:
   - Group lessons into modules based on their logical connections or complementary focus areas.
   - Place more advanced topics under higher-level modules (e.g., "Advanced Swift" or "Architectural Patterns").
   - Avoid creating single-lesson modules unless absolutely necessary.

6. **Learning Goals**:
   - Consider the main goal: interview preparation for iOS developers. Group the lessons in a way that makes it easy to follow a progression from foundational knowledge to advanced techniques.

### Input Format

Here’s an example list of lesson metadata that you will be provided to organize within the modules. Focus on the **title** and **description** fields for this task.

```json
[
  {
    "title": "Swift Concurrency with Async-Await and Structured Concurrency",
    "tags": ["concurrency", "async/await", "structured concurrency", "actors", "Swift", "asynchronous programming", "Swift concurrency"],
    "description": "A detailed exploration of Swift’s concurrency model, covering async/await, structured concurrency, and actors for efficient asynchronous programming."
  },
  {
    "title": "SOLID Principles for iOS Development",
    "tags": ["solid", "solid principles", "clean", "clean architecture", "software architecture", "architecture", "software design"],
    "description": "An in-depth lesson on the SOLID principles and their implementation in iOS development to enhance code modularity, maintainability, and scalability."
  },

  },
  {
    "title": "Variables and Constants in Swift",
    "tags": ["swift", "variables", "constants", "let", "var", "iOS development", "programming basics"],
    "description": "A lesson on the use of variables and constants in Swift, explaining the differences between 'let' and 'var' and guiding when to use each."
  },
  {
    "title": "Memory Management in Swift",
    "tags": ["memory management", "ARC", "automatic reference counting", "retain cycles", "weak references", "strong references", "unowned references"],
    "description": "A comprehensive lesson on memory management concepts in Swift, covering ARC, strong, weak, and unowned references, retain cycles, and best practices for avoiding memory leaks in complex applications."
  }
]
```

Your task is to organize these lessons into a structured course outline using the given guidelines.

---

Ensure that your output has the correct structure, logically grouping related lessons and creating submodules as needed. The output should be a structured, organized **YAML file** with the title `"iOS Interview Preparation"` at the top level and a coherent hierarchy of modules and lessons beneath.
