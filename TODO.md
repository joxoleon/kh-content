# TODO

## Lesson Prompts
    Update lesson prompts to contain the following:
        [x] Estimated reading time - WILL DO WITH CONTENT programatically!
        [x] Estimated difficulty level
        [x] Update the id system, so that it uses the lowercased snakecase title as the id
        [] [difficult] Add potential links to other lessons, maybe with lesson id's but this is something that might have to be done manually

## Module Prompts
    [] Create a module prompt that is going to organize the lessons into modules
        [] Provide the list of lesson titles for it (and it will turn the titles into ids)
        [] Use GPT to generate a proper prompt that is going to be used for this

## Modules
    [x] Integrate Module Parser~~
    [x] Parse modules within the CLI tool and output according content files

## CLI Tool

## KHContentModels
    [] Create the contentModels package within this repo
    [] Update the CLI tool to use that package
    [] Create a package within the KnowledgeHub repo that is going to be using this package and that will contain the lesson/module repositories
