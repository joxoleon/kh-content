# KnowledgeHub Content Repository

This repository serves as the foundation for managing educational content on the KnowledgeHub platform. It encompasses a well-organized structure for lessons, learning modules, prompt templates, and tools to automate content parsing, making it efficient and scalable for both local development and integration with iOS applications.

## Repository Overview

This repository is designed to hold structured educational content that can be used to create comprehensive learning modules and deliver interactive lessons. The content is organized into logical directories and includes tools for content generation, formatting, and deployment.

### Key Components

#### Content
- **Lessons**: Contains a collection of Markdown-formatted files, each representing a standalone lesson. Lessons are structured for consistency, readability, and ease of parsing.
- **Modules**: Contains YAML files defining learning modules that group related lessons and submodules. Modules serve as structured containers for lessons, making it easier to navigate through various topics.
- **Parsed Content (Output)**: The repository generates JSON files from the raw Markdown and YAML files for easier integration with applications. These JSON files provide a unified view of all lessons and modules, making them accessible and easy to serve from a backend or integrate directly into mobile applications.

#### Tools
- **Content Parsing CLI**: A command-line tool designed to automate parsing of the lesson and module files. This tool consolidates content into JSON files by reading Markdown and YAML structures, ensuring data is always up-to-date and ready for deployment.
- **Content Baking Workflow**: Configured to run locally and through CI/CD (e.g., GitHub Actions) to generate updated JSON files after new content is added. This workflow maintains a fresh, app-friendly JSON dataset that reflects the latest updates from merged content.

#### Prompts
- **Prompt Templates**: Provides prompt templates for generating new lessons and modules. These templates help ensure consistency and efficiency in content creation by providing a standard format for instructional text, quiz questions, and other lesson features.

#### Swift Package (KHContent)
This package provides iOS applications with models and APIs to interact with parsed KnowledgeHub content. By integrating KHContent, applications gain access to features like content retrieval, lesson management, and structured delivery of learning materials.

- **Models**: Define the structures for `Lesson` and `Module` to match the parsed JSON output, making it easy to decode and display content within the app.
- **Content Service**: A lightweight API that facilitates fetching content from JSON files stored locally or from a remote backend, providing a seamless interface for developers working with KnowledgeHub content in their iOS applications.

## Development Workflow

1. **Adding New Content**: Place new lessons in the `Lessons` directory and modules in the `Modules` directory, following the Markdown and YAML formats, respectively.
2. **Running Content Parsing Tool**: Use the CLI tool to parse all lessons and modules and generate updated JSON files for application use.
3. **Committing Changes**: Submit updates to content or module structures through pull requests. On merging, CI/CD pipelines run the content parsing tool to regenerate JSON files, keeping data fresh and deployment-ready.

## Usage of Generated JSON Files

The JSON files generated by the content parsing tool are designed to be lightweight, portable, and ready to serve through a backend or integrated into a mobile app. Applications can use the generated files for offline access, or they can be hosted remotely to allow dynamic updates to lesson content.
