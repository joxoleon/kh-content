In **iOS development**, effective concurrency management is crucial to ensure smooth user experiences and optimal performance. This lesson will explore common concurrency design patterns such as the **producer-consumer**, **delegation**, and **observer** patterns, providing insight into their implementations and use cases.\n\n> **Concurrency design patterns** help manage asynchronous tasks, ensuring that data is correctly shared and synchronized between different threads.",

      "content" : "# Concurrency Design Patterns in iOS\n\n## 1. Producer-Consumer Pattern\n\nThe **producer-consumer** pattern is a classic concurrency model that involves two types of processes: producers and consumers. Producers generate data or tasks, while consumers process that data. This pattern is particularly useful when tasks are generated at different rates or when data needs to be processed asynchronously.\n\n### Implementation in iOS\n\nIn iOS, you can implement the producer-consumer pattern using **DispatchQueues**. Here’s a practical example:\n\n```swift\nimport Foundation\n\nlet queue = DispatchQueue(label: \"com.example.queue\", attributes: .concurrent)\nlet semaphore = DispatchSemaphore(value: 1)\n\nvar buffer: [Int] = []\n\n\/\/ Producer\nqueue.async {\n    for i in 0..<10 {\n        semaphore.wait() \/\/ Wait for access to the buffer\n        buffer.append(i)\n        print(\"Produced: \\(i)\")\n        semaphore.signal() \/\/ Signal that the buffer is available\n    }\n}\n\n\/\/ Consumer\nqueue.async {\n    for _ in 0..<10 {\n        semaphore.wait() \/\/ Wait for access to the buffer\n        if let item = buffer.first {\n            buffer.removeFirst()\n            print(\"Consumed: \\(item)\")\n        }\n        semaphore.signal() \/\/ Signal that the buffer is available\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the producer adds integers to a buffer, while the consumer removes them. The **semaphore** ensures that access to the buffer is synchronized.\n\n## 2. Delegation Pattern\n\nThe **delegation** pattern is a widely used design pattern in iOS that allows one object to communicate with another object when an event occurs. This is particularly useful for handling user interactions or asynchronous operations.\n\n### Implementation in iOS\n\nA common scenario for delegation is when a view controller wants to handle events from a custom view. Here’s how to implement it:\n\n```swift\nprotocol MyCustomViewDelegate: AnyObject {\n    func didTapButton()\n}\n\nclass MyCustomView: UIView {\n    weak var delegate: MyCustomViewDelegate?\n\n    @objc func buttonTapped() {\n        delegate?.didTapButton()\n    }\n}\n\nclass MyViewController: UIViewController, MyCustomViewDelegate {\n    let customView = MyCustomView()\n\n    override func viewDidLoad() {\n        super.viewDidLoad()\n        customView.delegate = self\n    }\n\n    func didTapButton() {\n        print(\"Button was tapped!\")\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this implementation, `MyCustomView` notifies its delegate (in this case, `MyViewController`) when a button is tapped.\n\n## 3. Observer Pattern\n\nThe **observer** pattern allows an object (the subject) to notify other objects (observers) when its state changes. This is particularly useful for implementing event-driven architectures.\n\n### Implementation in iOS\n\nIn iOS, you can use **NotificationCenter** to implement the observer pattern:\n\n```swift\nclass MyObserver {\n    init() {\n        NotificationCenter.default.addObserver(self, selector: #selector(handleNotification), name: NSNotification.Name(\"MyNotification\"), object: nil)\n    }\n\n    @objc func handleNotification() {\n        print(\"Notification received!\")\n    }\n}\n\nclass MyNotifier {\n    func notify() {\n        NotificationCenter.default.post(name: NSNotification.Name(\"MyNotification\"), object: nil)\n    }\n}\n```\n\nHere, `MyObserver` listens for notifications from `MyNotifier`. When a notification is posted, the observer responds accordingly."
