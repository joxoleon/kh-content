It allows developers to execute tasks asynchronously or synchronously on different threads, thereby utilizing system resources more efficiently.\n\n> GCD provides a simpler way to write concurrent code by abstracting the thread management process.\n\nThe primary purpose of GCD is to enable developers to execute multiple tasks simultaneously, improving responsiveness in applications. This lesson will cover the foundational concepts of GCD, including **dispatch queues**, **async and sync operations**, and **task prioritization**.",

      "content" : "## Understanding Grand Central Dispatch (GCD)\n\n### What is GCD?\n**GCD** is a low-level API for managing concurrent code execution on multicore hardware. It provides a lightweight and efficient way to create and manage queues of tasks that can run in the background. The main components of GCD are **dispatch queues**, which can be either serial or concurrent.\n\n### Dispatch Queues\n1. **Serial Dispatch Queue**: Executes tasks one at a time in the order they are added. This is useful when tasks depend on each other. For example:\n\n        let serialQueue = DispatchQueue(label: \"com.example.serialQueue\")\n        serialQueue.async {\n            print(\"Task 1 started.\")\n            \/\/ Simulate a task\n            sleep(2) \n            print(\"Task 1 finished.\")\n        }\n        serialQueue.async {\n            print(\"Task 2 started.\")\n        }\n\n   In this case, \"Task 2\" will only start after \"Task 1\" has finished.\n\n2. **Concurrent Dispatch Queue**: Executes tasks simultaneously, allowing multiple tasks to run at the same time. For instance:\n\n        let concurrentQueue = DispatchQueue(label: \"com.example.concurrentQueue\", attributes: .concurrent)\n        concurrentQueue.async {\n            print(\"Task A started.\")\n            \/\/ Simulate a task\n            sleep(2) \n            print(\"Task A finished.\")\n        }\n        concurrentQueue.async {\n            print(\"Task B started.\")\n        }\n\n   Here, \"Task A\" and \"Task B\" can run in parallel.\n\n### Asynchronous vs Synchronous Operations\n- **Asynchronous (async)**: Adds a task to a queue and immediately returns, allowing the next line of code to execute without waiting for the task to complete. For example:\n\n        DispatchQueue.global().async {\n            print(\"Async task started.\")\n        }\n        print(\"This prints before the async task finishes.\")\n\n- **Synchronous (sync)**: Adds a task to a queue and waits until the task completes before moving on to the next line of code. For example:\n\n        DispatchQueue.global().sync {\n            print(\"Sync task started.\")\n        }\n        print(\"This prints after the sync task finishes.\")\n\n### Task Prioritization\nGCD allows you to prioritize tasks by using different types of queues:\n- **Main Queue**: A serial queue that executes tasks on the main thread, mainly for UI updates.\n- **Global Queues**: Concurrent queues provided by GCD with varying levels of priority (high, default, low, background).\n\nExample of using a global queue with priority:\n\n        DispatchQueue.global(qos: .userInitiated).async {\n            print(\"High priority task started.\")\n        }\n\n### Best Practices\n- Use **asynchronous operations** for tasks that can run in the background to keep the UI responsive.\n- Avoid using **sync** on the main thread to prevent blocking the user interface.\n- Prioritize tasks intelligently to enhance performance based on user experience.\n\nBy understanding and effectively using GCD, developers can create responsive and efficient applications that leverage the power of multicore processors.",
