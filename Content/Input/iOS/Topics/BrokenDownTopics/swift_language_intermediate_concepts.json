        "description" : "This lesson explores optionals in Swift, a fundamental concept that allows variables to hold either a value or nil. You'll learn about optional types, forced unwrapping, optional binding, and how to safely work with optionals using guard and if let statements. The lesson will also touch on optional chaining and the significance of optionals in Swift's safety and error handling.",

        "description" : "Dive into closures in Swift, which are self-contained blocks of functionality that can be passed around and used in your code. This lesson covers the syntax of closures, capturing values, and how to use closures as function parameters. You'll also learn about trailing closure syntax, escaping vs non-escaping closures, and practical examples of closures in asynchronous programming.",

        "description" : "This lesson focuses on the differences between structs and classes in Swift. It discusses value types vs. reference types, memory management implications, and when to choose one over the other. You will learn about mutability, inheritance in classes, and how to leverage the strengths of both structs and classes in your iOS applications."

        "description" : "Learn how to use extensions in Swift to add new functionality to existing classes, structs, or enums. This lesson covers the syntax for creating extensions, adding computed properties, methods, and conforming to protocols. You'll see practical examples of how extensions can help organize code, enhance readability, and promote code reuse.",
