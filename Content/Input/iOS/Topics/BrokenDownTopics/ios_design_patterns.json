        "description" : "This lesson introduces the concept of design patterns and their importance in iOS development. It covers the four main categories of design patterns: creational, structural, behavioral, and how these patterns help in creating scalable and maintainable applications.",

      },
      {
        "description" : "Explore the delegation design pattern, which allows one object to send messages to another object when an event occurs. This lesson covers its implementation in iOS, common use cases such as UITableView and UICollectionView, and how to effectively use delegates to manage communication between objects.",
        "title" : "Delegation Pattern"
      },
      {
        "description" : "Dive into the singleton design pattern, which restricts a class to a single instance and provides a global point of access. This lesson discusses when to use singletons, how to implement them in Swift, and potential pitfalls, such as thread safety and testing challenges.",
        "title" : "Singleton Pattern"
      },
      {
        "title" : "Factory Pattern",
        "description" : "Learn about the factory design pattern, which is used to create objects without specifying the exact class of object that will be created. This lesson covers the different types of factory patterns (simple factory, factory method, and abstract factory), their implementation in iOS, and practical examples."
      },
      {
        "title" : "Observer Pattern",
        "description" : "Understand the observer design pattern, which allows an object to notify other objects about changes in its state. This lesson explains how to implement the observer pattern using NotificationCenter and KVO in Swift, and discusses practical applications such as event handling and data binding."
      },
      {
        "title" : "Strategy Pattern",
        "description" : "This lesson focuses on the strategy design pattern, which enables selecting an algorithm's behavior at runtime. It covers how to define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable, along with practical examples in iOS applications."

      {
        "title" : "Combining Design Patterns",
        "description" : "Explore how different design patterns can be combined to solve complex problems in iOS development. This lesson presents case studies where patterns like delegation, observer, and strategy work together to create flexible and reusable code."
