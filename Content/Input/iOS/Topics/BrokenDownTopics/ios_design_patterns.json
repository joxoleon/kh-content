        "title" : "Introduction to iOS Design Patterns",
        "description" : "This lesson provides an overview of design patterns in iOS development. It covers the significance of design patterns in software engineering, how they help in creating scalable and maintainable applications, and introduces the most common patterns used in iOS."
      },
      {
        "description" : "Explore the delegation design pattern, which is widely used in iOS for communication between objects. This lesson covers how to implement delegation, practical use cases, and examples demonstrating its application in UIKit components.",
        "title" : "Understanding the Delegation Pattern"
      },
      {
        "description" : "Delve into the factory design pattern, which provides a way to create objects without specifying the exact class of the object that will be created. This lesson includes explanations of different types of factory patterns, their implementations, and examples in iOS, such as creating views or models.",
        "title" : "Factory Design Pattern in iOS"
      },
      {
        "description" : "Learn about the singleton design pattern, which restricts a class to a single instance and provides a global point of access to it. This lesson discusses the benefits and drawbacks of singletons, how to implement them in Swift, and scenarios where they are commonly used.",

      },
      {
        "title" : "The Observer Pattern Explained",
        "description" : "This lesson focuses on the observer design pattern, which allows objects to be notified of changes in other objects. It covers how to implement this pattern using NotificationCenter and KVO in iOS, along with practical examples to illustrate its usage in real-world applications."
      },
      {
        "title" : "Strategy Pattern for Flexible Algorithms",
        "description" : "Explore the strategy design pattern, which enables selecting an algorithm's behavior at runtime. This lesson provides insights into how to implement this pattern in iOS, discussing its benefits, use cases, and examples that demonstrate its effectiveness in managing different behaviors."
