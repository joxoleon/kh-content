## Data Persistence Strategies in iOS

Data persistence is a crucial aspect of iOS development, enabling applications to store and retrieve data across sessions. Understanding the different data persistence strategies available is essential for building efficient and responsive applications. In this lesson, we will explore key methods such as **UserDefaults**, **Core Data**, and **file storage**, discussing their trade-offs and when to use each based on application requirements.

> Data persistence allows applications to maintain state and user preferences, enhancing the overall user experience.

## Overview of Data Persistence Options

### UserDefaults
**UserDefaults** is a simple key-value store primarily used for storing small amounts of data, such as user preferences and settings. It is easy to use and allows for quick retrieval of data.

**Example Usage:**
To save a user preference, you can do the following:

    let defaults = UserDefaults.standard
    defaults.set(true, forKey: "isUserLoggedIn")

To retrieve the stored value:

    let isLoggedIn = defaults.bool(forKey: "isUserLoggedIn")

**When to Use:**
- Ideal for lightweight data that does not require complex structures.
- Best for user preferences, small configurations, or flags.

### Core Data
**Core Data** is a powerful framework designed for managing an object graph. It provides a structured way to handle data, including relationships, and supports complex queries. Core Data can persist data to various storage options, including SQLite and binary formats.

**Example Usage:**
Define a simple entity and save an object:

    import CoreData
    
    let context = (UIApplication.shared.delegate as! AppDelegate).persistentContainer.viewContext
    let newUser = User(context: context)
    newUser.username = "john_doe"
    
    do {
        try context.save()
    } catch {
        print("Failed saving")
    }

**When to Use:**
- Suitable for applications with complex data models and relationships.
- Preferable when you need to perform extensive queries and data manipulation.

### File Storage
File storage allows you to save data directly to the file system. This can be used for storing larger files, such as images or documents, in a structured way.

**Example Usage:**
To write data to a file:

    let fileManager = FileManager.default
    let path = fileManager.urls(for: .documentDirectory, in: .userDomainMask).first?.appendingPathComponent("data.txt")

    do {
        try "Hello, World!".write(to: path!, atomically: true, encoding: .utf8)
    } catch {
        print("Failed to write to file")
    }

To read from the file:

    do {
        let content = try String(contentsOf: path!, encoding: .utf8)
        print(content)
    } catch {
        print("Failed to read from file")
    }

**When to Use:**
- Best for storing large files or unstructured data.
- Useful when the data format does not fit into a database model.

### Comparison of Strategies
Choosing the right data persistence strategy depends on the application's specific needs:

- **UserDefaults** should be used for simple key-value pairs.
- **Core Data** is best for complex data models requiring relationships and extensive querying.
- **File Storage** is optimal for larger files and unstructured data.

## Discussion

### Pros and Cons
Each data persistence method has its advantages and disadvantages:
- **UserDefaults**: 
    - **Pros**: Simple, lightweight, easy to implement.
    - **Cons**: Not suitable for large data or complex structures.
  
- **Core Data**: 
    - **Pros**: Powerful, efficient for large datasets, supports complex queries.
    - **Cons**: Steeper learning curve, overkill for small datasets.

- **File Storage**: 
    - **Pros**: Flexible in terms of data types, suitable for large files.
    - **Cons**: Requires manual management of data integrity and structure.

### Common Use Cases
- Use **UserDefaults** for saving user settings like theme preferences or language choices.
- Employ **Core Data** in applications that handle large amounts of data, such as note-taking apps, where entities and relationships are essential.
- Opt for **file storage** for apps that handle media files, like photo or video storage applications.
