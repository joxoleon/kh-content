# Data Migration Strategies in Core Data

Data migration in **Core Data** is a vital process that allows developers to effectively manage changes in data models over time. As applications evolve, schema changes are often necessary, and understanding how to migrate existing data is crucial for maintaining data integrity and usability. 

> **Data migration** refers to the process of transferring data between storage types, formats, or systems, particularly when changes are made to data structures.

In this lesson, we will explore two primary types of migration strategies: **lightweight** and **heavyweight** migration, along with best practices to ensure a seamless transition and maintain data integrity.

# Understanding Data Migration Strategies

## Lightweight Migration

**Lightweight migrations** are the preferred method when making simple changes to your data model. This type of migration allows Core Data to automatically handle schema changes without requiring a lot of manual intervention. 

### When to Use Lightweight Migration

Lightweight migration is suitable for the following changes:
- Adding new attributes to existing entities
- Renaming attributes
- Changing attribute types (under certain conditions)
- Adding new entities to the model

### Example of Lightweight Migration

To enable lightweight migration, you need to set specific options while initializing your `NSPersistentStoreCoordinator`. Hereâ€™s an example:

    let options = [
        NSMigratePersistentStoresAutomaticallyOption: true,
        NSInferMappingModelAutomaticallyOption: true
    ]

    do {
        try persistentStoreCoordinator.addPersistentStore(ofType: NSSQLiteStoreType,
                                                          configurationName: nil,
                                                          at: storeURL,
                                                          options: options)
    } catch {
        fatalError("Unresolved error \(error)")
    }

In this example, the options allow Core Data to infer the mapping model and handle the migration automatically.

## Heavyweight Migration

**Heavyweight migrations** are necessary when your changes are more complex, such as:
- Deleting existing entities
- Reorganizing the data model significantly
- Changing relationships between entities

### Creating a Mapping Model

To perform a heavyweight migration, you need to create a mapping model. This mapping model defines how to transform data from the old model to the new model. 

1. In Xcode, select your data model file.
2. Choose `Editor` > `Add Mapping Model`.
3. Follow the wizard to create a mapping model between the source and destination models.

### Implementing Heavyweight Migration

Once you have your mapping model, you can perform the migration like so:

    let mappingModel = NSMappingModel(from: [sourceModel, destinationModel])
    let migrationManager = NSMigrationManager(sourceModel: sourceModel, destinationModel: destinationModel)

    do {
        try migrationManager.migrateStore(from: sourceStoreURL, 
                                           sourceType: NSSQLiteStoreType, 
                                           options: nil, 
                                           with: mappingModel, 
                                           toDestinationURL: destinationStoreURL, 
                                           destinationType: NSSQLiteStoreType, 
                                           destinationOptions: nil)
    } catch {
        fatalError("Migration failed: \(error)")
    }

This approach gives you more control over how data is transformed, making it suitable for complex scenarios.

## Best Practices for Data Migration

- **Test Migrations Thoroughly**: Always simulate migrations in a test environment before deploying them in production. 
- **Backup Data**: Ensure that you have backups of your data before performing any migration. This precaution helps prevent data loss.
- **Monitor Performance**: Keep an eye on the performance of your application during migration, as large datasets can lead to performance bottlenecks.

# Discussion

The choice between lightweight and heavyweight migration techniques depends largely on the complexity of the changes being made to the data model. 

### Pros and Cons

- **Lightweight Migration**:
  - **Pros**: Simple to implement, requires less code, and allows for quick updates.
  - **Cons**: Limited to straightforward changes; not suitable for complex data model alterations.

- **Heavyweight Migration**:
  - **Pros**: Provides control over data transformations and is suitable for complex changes.
  - **Cons**: Requires more setup (e.g., creating mapping models) and can be more error-prone.

### Common Use Cases

Lightweight migrations are common in iterative development where new features are added frequently, while heavyweight migrations are often necessary during significant updates or overhauls of the application data structure.
