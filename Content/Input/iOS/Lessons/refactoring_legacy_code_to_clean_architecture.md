## Refactoring Legacy Code to Clean Architecture

Refactoring legacy code is a critical skill for software engineers, especially in the context of **iOS development**. This lesson explores the principles of **Clean Architecture** and provides actionable strategies to incrementally improve the architecture of existing applications. The goal is to enhance maintainability, testability, and scalability while reducing technical debt.

> Clean Architecture focuses on separating concerns and ensuring that the business logic remains independent of frameworks, UI, and external agencies.

This guide will help you identify common issues in legacy code and offer structured approaches for refactoring towards a more organized and clean architecture.

## Understanding Clean Architecture

**Clean Architecture** is an architectural pattern that emphasizes separation of concerns and independence from frameworks. It is designed to make the codebase more modular, allowing for easier testing and maintenance. The main components include:

- **Entities**: Business rules that encapsulate the core logic.
- **Use Cases**: Application-specific business rules that interact with the entities.
- **Interface Adapters**: Adapters that convert data from one format to another, allowing communication between the outer layers (UI, frameworks) and the inner layers (business logic).
- **Frameworks and Drivers**: The external components such as databases, UI frameworks, and APIs.

### Step-by-Step Refactoring Strategy

Refactoring a legacy iOS application to Clean Architecture can be challenging. Hereâ€™s a structured approach:

1. **Assess the Current Architecture**:
   - Identify the existing structure and pinpoint areas of tight coupling and high complexity.
   - Use tools like dependency graphs to visualize relationships between components.

2. **Define the Core Business Logic**:
   - Isolate the core entities and use cases from the rest of the application.
   - For example, consider a simple app managing tasks:

          struct Task {
              var id: Int
              var title: String
              var isCompleted: Bool
          }

          class TaskManager {
              private var tasks: [Task] = []

              func addTask(title: String) {
                  let newTask = Task(id: tasks.count + 1, title: title, isCompleted: false)
                  tasks.append(newTask)
              }
          }

3. **Create Use Cases**:
   - Define use cases that represent the actions the user can perform. Each use case should interact with the entities, serving as an intermediary. 

          class AddTaskUseCase {
              private let taskManager: TaskManager

              init(taskManager: TaskManager) {
                  self.taskManager = taskManager
              }

              func execute(title: String) {
                  taskManager.addTask(title: title)
              }
          }

4. **Implement Interface Adapters**:
   - Introduce adapters that facilitate communication between the UI and the business logic. This could involve creating view models that format data for the UI.

5. **Gradually Refactor UI Components**:
   - Start replacing UIKit components with SwiftUI or other frameworks, ensuring they interact with the new architecture through the defined use cases.

6. **Test Incrementally**:
   - As you refactor, ensure that you have a robust suite of unit tests. This will help you catch any regressions and validate that your architecture is sound.

### Real-World Example

Consider a legacy app that directly interacts with a database and has mixed business logic with UI code. By following the steps above, you would first isolate the database interactions into repositories that can be tested separately, then define use cases to manage the flow of data between the UI and the database.

## Discussion

### Pros of Clean Architecture
- **Improved Testability**: Clean separation allows for easier unit testing of business logic.
- **Scalability**: New features can be added with minimal impact on existing code.
- **Maintainability**: Clear structure helps new developers understand the codebase quickly.

### Cons of Clean Architecture
- **Initial Overhead**: Refactoring can require significant upfront investment in time and resources.
- **Complexity**: Understanding and implementing the architecture requires a higher level of knowledge and experience.

### Use Cases
Clean Architecture is particularly useful in large applications where maintaining a clear separation of concerns is vital. For instance, enterprise-level applications that require frequent updates and new feature additions can benefit significantly from this architecture.
