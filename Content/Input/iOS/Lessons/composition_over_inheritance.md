# Composition Over Inheritance

**Composition Over Inheritance** is a fundamental software design principle that emphasizes the use of **composition** to achieve flexibility and reusability in code over traditional **inheritance**. This principle is particularly relevant in the context of **iOS development**, where it can lead to cleaner, more maintainable code architectures.

> Inheritance allows a class to inherit properties and behaviors from a parent class, while composition involves creating complex types by combining objects with distinct functionalities.

Understanding when to use composition over inheritance is key to building scalable applications. This lesson will explore the benefits and practical implementations of this principle in Swift.

# Understanding Composition Over Inheritance

## What is Composition?

**Composition** involves building complex classes by combining simpler, reusable components rather than extending a base class. This approach allows for greater flexibility since behaviors can be added or changed at runtime without altering the class hierarchy.

For example, consider a simple implementation of composition in Swift:

    protocol Drawable {
        func draw()
    }

    class Circle: Drawable {
        func draw() {
            print("Drawing a Circle")
        }
    }

    class Square: Drawable {
        func draw() {
            print("Drawing a Square")
        }
    }

    class ShapeRenderer {
        private var drawable: Drawable
        
        init(drawable: Drawable) {
            self.drawable = drawable
        }
        
        func render() {
            drawable.draw()
        }
    }

In this example, `ShapeRenderer` can use any object that conforms to the `Drawable` protocol, allowing for flexibility. You can easily add new shapes without modifying existing code.

## Benefits of Composition Over Inheritance

1. **Flexibility and Reusability**: By composing objects, you can easily swap out components. This is especially useful in iOS where you might want to change behaviors dynamically. For example, a view controller can use different data sources or services without needing a complex inheritance structure.

2. **Avoiding Fragile Base Class Problem**: Inheritance can lead to issues where changes in the base class inadvertently affect derived classes, making the codebase fragile. Composition mitigates this risk by avoiding tight coupling between classes.

3. **Encapsulation**: Composition promotes better encapsulation as components can be developed and tested independently. This modular approach leads to cleaner code.

4. **Dynamic Behavior**: With composition, you can alter the behavior of objects at runtime. This is particularly useful in scenarios such as dependency injection, where you can inject different implementations of a service.

## Practical Implementation in iOS

To illustrate how composition can be beneficial in an iOS application, let's consider a scenario where we have different types of user notifications (e.g., email notifications, SMS notifications).

    protocol Notifiable {
        func notify()
    }

    class EmailNotification: Notifiable {
        func notify() {
            print("Sending Email Notification")
        }
    }

    class SMSNotification: Notifiable {
        func notify() {
            print("Sending SMS Notification")
        }
    }

    class User {
        private var notifier: Notifiable
        
        init(notifier: Notifiable) {
            self.notifier = notifier
        }
        
        func sendNotification() {
            notifier.notify()
        }
    }

Here, the `User` class can utilize any notification method by simply changing the `notifier` property. This allows for easy extension and maintenance of the code as new notification types can be added without modifying the `User` class.

**Pros of Composition**:
- Encourages **modularity** and **decoupling** of components.
- Leads to more **testable** code since components can be independently mocked.
- Facilitates **runtime flexibility** allowing for dynamic behavior changes.

**Cons of Composition**:
- Can lead to more complex systems if overused or misused.
- May require additional boilerplate code to manage relationships between components.

**Common Use Cases**:
- **UI Components**: In iOS, using composition allows developers to create complex UI elements without deep inheritance hierarchies, promoting reuse of components.
- **Service Layers**: By composing different service classes, you can create a robust and flexible architecture for networking or data management.

Comparatively, while inheritance can seem simpler for establishing class hierarchies, it often results in code that is harder to change and maintain. Composition, on the other hand, fosters a more adaptable and maintainable codebase.
