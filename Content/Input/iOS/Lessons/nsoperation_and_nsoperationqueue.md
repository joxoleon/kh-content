## NSOperation and NSOperationQueue

In the realm of iOS development, managing concurrent operations is crucial for creating responsive applications. **NSOperation** and **NSOperationQueue** provide a robust framework for handling these tasks with more control compared to **Grand Central Dispatch (GCD)**. 

> **NSOperation** is an abstract class that represents a single unit of work, while an **NSOperationQueue** manages the execution of multiple operations, allowing for task prioritization and dependency management. 

This lesson will explore the key features of NSOperation and NSOperationQueue, including operation dependencies, cancellation, and task prioritization, with practical examples to demonstrate their application.

## Understanding NSOperation and NSOperationQueue

### What is NSOperation?

**NSOperation** is a class that encapsulates a single unit of work. Unlike GCD, which relies on blocks of code, NSOperation allows for more advanced features, such as:

- **Cancellation**: Operations can be cancelled, allowing for more control over ongoing tasks.
- **Dependencies**: You can create dependencies between operations, ensuring that certain tasks are completed before others begin.
- **Execution States**: NSOperation has built-in mechanisms to track the execution state of operations.

Here is a simple example demonstrating a custom NSOperation:

    class MyOperation: NSOperation {
        override func main() {
            if isCancelled {
                return
            }
            print("Performing my operation.")
        }
    }

### What is NSOperationQueue?

**NSOperationQueue** is a class that manages the execution of multiple NSOperation instances. It allows you to control the maximum number of concurrent operations and provides features such as:

- **Max Concurrent Operation Count**: You can limit the number of operations that run simultaneously.
- **Operation Prioritization**: Operations can be assigned different priorities, affecting their execution order.
- **Completion Blocks**: You can specify blocks of code to execute upon completion of operations.

Here’s an example of how to use NSOperationQueue:

    let operationQueue = NSOperationQueue()
    operationQueue.maxConcurrentOperationCount = 3

    let operation1 = MyOperation()
    let operation2 = MyOperation()
    let operation3 = MyOperation()

    operationQueue.addOperations([operation1, operation2, operation3], waitUntilFinished: false)

### Operation Dependencies

One of the powerful features of NSOperation is the ability to set dependencies between operations. This ensures that one operation waits for another to complete before it begins. This is particularly useful in scenarios where tasks are interrelated.

Example of setting dependencies:

    let operationA = MyOperation()
    let operationB = MyOperation()
    operationB.addDependency(operationA)

    operationQueue.addOperations([operationA, operationB], waitUntilFinished: false)

In this case, **operationB** will only start after **operationA** has finished executing.

### Cancellation of Operations

Cancelling operations is straightforward with NSOperation. You can check if an operation has been cancelled inside its `main` function. Here’s how to implement cancellation:

    class CancelableOperation: NSOperation {
        override func main() {
            if isCancelled {
                return
            }
            // Perform task
            print("Task is running.")
        }
    }

Cancellation can be invoked like this:

    let cancelableOperation = CancelableOperation()
    operationQueue.addOperation(cancelableOperation)
    cancelableOperation.cancel()

If `cancel()` is called before the operation starts executing, it will not run.

### Prioritizing Operations

NSOperation allows you to set the priority of individual operations using the `queuePriority` property. This can influence the order in which operations are executed in the queue.

Example of setting priorities:

    operation1.queuePriority = .high
    operation2.queuePriority = .low

In this example, **operation1** will be executed before **operation2** if both are ready to run.

## Discussion

### Pros and Cons of NSOperation and NSOperationQueue

**Pros**:
- **Fine-grained control**: NSOperation provides more options for managing concurrent tasks compared to GCD.
- **Cancellation support**: Easy to cancel operations if they are no longer needed.
- **Dependencies**: Creating dependencies between tasks is straightforward, allowing for organized execution flows.

**Cons**:
- **Overhead**: NSOperation and NSOperationQueue can introduce more overhead than GCD, particularly for simple tasks.
- **Complexity**: Managing many operations with dependencies can lead to complex code structures.

### Use Cases

NSOperation and NSOperationQueue are particularly useful in scenarios where:

- You need to download multiple resources, but some resources depend on others.
- Tasks need to be cancelled based on user actions, such as loading data in the background.
- Operations require completion handlers to execute code after finishing.
