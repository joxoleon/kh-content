# Structs vs. Classes in Swift

In Swift, understanding the differences between **structs** and **classes** is essential for effective programming. Both are used to create complex data types, but they differ significantly in how they handle data and memory management.

> **Structs** are **value types**, meaning they are copied when they are assigned to a new variable or constant, or when they are passed to a function.  
> **Classes**, on the other hand, are **reference types**, which means they share a single instance when assigned or passed around.

This lesson will delve into these distinctions and discuss when to use each type, along with the implications of mutability and data copying.

# Understanding Structs and Classes

## Value Types vs. Reference Types

### Structs
When you create a new instance of a `struct`, Swift makes a copy of that instance. This behavior means that changes to one instance do not affect another. This is particularly useful for representing simple data models, such as **coordinates** or **dimensions**.

Example of a struct:

    struct Point {
        var x: Int
        var y: Int
        
        func description() -> String {
            return "Point at (\(x), \(y))"
        }
    }

Creating two instances:

    var pointA = Point(x: 10, y: 20)
    var pointB = pointA  // pointB is a copy of pointA
    pointB.x = 30       // Changing pointB does not affect pointA

### Classes
In contrast, when you create a new instance of a `class`, you're working with a reference to that instance. This means that if you modify the instance through one reference, all references will reflect that change.

Example of a class:

    class Rectangle {
        var width: Int
        var height: Int
        
        init(width: Int, height: Int) {
            self.width = width
            self.height = height
        }
        
        func area() -> Int {
            return width * height
        }
    }

Creating two instances:

    var rectangleA = Rectangle(width: 10, height: 20)
    var rectangleB = rectangleA  // rectangleB references rectangleA
    rectangleB.width = 30         // Changing rectangleB affects rectangleA

## Inheritance Capabilities

- **Structs** do not support inheritance. You cannot derive one struct from another. This can make them simpler and safer for certain use cases.
- **Classes**, however, can inherit from other classes. This enables a more complex and flexible architecture.

Example of class inheritance:

    class Shape {
        var numberOfSides: Int
        
        init(sides: Int) {
            self.numberOfSides = sides
        }
    }

    class Triangle: Shape {
        init() {
            super.init(sides: 3)
        }
    }

## Mutability

Structs and classes also differ in how they handle mutability. 

### Mutability in Structs
To modify properties of a struct, you need to define the instance as `var`. If a struct instance is assigned to a constant (`let`), its properties cannot be altered:

    let pointC = Point(x: 5, y: 5)
    // pointC.x = 10  // This would cause a compile-time error

### Mutability in Classes
Classes can have their properties modified regardless of whether they are declared with `let` or `var`, as long as the properties themselves are declared as `var`:

    let rectangleC = Rectangle(width: 5, height: 10)
    rectangleC.width = 15  // This is valid

## Use Cases and Best Practices

When deciding whether to use a struct or a class, consider the following:

- **Use structs** when you need a lightweight data structure that encapsulates a few related values and doesn't require inheritance. They are ideal for representing simple data models.
- **Use classes** when you need reference semantics or when you require inheritance. Classes are better for managing shared state and complex relationships between objects.

### Pros and Cons
- **Pros of Structs**:
    - Simplicity: Structs are generally simpler to use and understand due to their value type nature.
    - Safety: Thereâ€™s less risk of unintended side effects since structs are copied, leading to safer code.
  
- **Cons of Structs**:
    - No inheritance: Structs cannot be extended through inheritance, limiting their use in certain design patterns.

- **Pros of Classes**:
    - Inheritance: Classes can be extended, allowing for a more flexible and reusable codebase.
    - Reference semantics: Classes enable shared state across multiple references.

- **Cons of Classes**:
    - Complexity: Classes can introduce complexity with shared mutable state, leading to potential bugs if not managed carefully.

### Common Use Cases
Structs are commonly used for model data in applications, such as a user profile or geometric shapes. Classes are often used for more complex entities, such as view controllers or data managers in an app.

# Key Takeaways

- **Structs are value types**: Changes create a new instance, ensuring data integrity.
- **Classes are reference types**: Changes affect all references to the same instance.
- **Structs do not support inheritance**: They are simpler and safer for small data models.
- **Classes support inheritance**: This allows for more complex relationships and behaviors.
- **Choose structs for data**: Use when you need lightweight and independent data structures.
- **Choose classes for shared state**: Use when you need reference semantics or a more complex hierarchy.
