=== Section: Swift Concurrency with Async/Await and Structured Concurrency Introduction ===
### Introduction to Swift Concurrency

With Swift 5.5, Apple introduced a new concurrency model that makes asynchronous programming more intuitive and efficient. The **async/await** syntax allows developers to write asynchronous code that looks and behaves more like synchronous code, enhancing readability and reducing error-prone callback structures. Coupled with **structured concurrency** and **actors**, Swift's concurrency model is designed to handle concurrent tasks safely and efficiently.

> **Async/await** in Swift simplifies asynchronous calls by enabling a linear code flow while handling concurrency in the background.

In this lesson, we’ll cover how async/await works, what structured concurrency offers, and how to manage asynchronous tasks safely with **actors**.

### Async/Await in Swift

The **async/await** model enables you to define functions that perform asynchronous operations in a sequential and readable manner. Functions marked as `async` can pause execution and resume once a task completes, allowing other tasks to execute concurrently.

#### Declaring Async Functions

    func fetchUserData() async -> UserData {
        // Function that fetches user data asynchronously
    }

To call an async function, use the `await` keyword:

    let userData = await fetchUserData()

### Structured Concurrency

**Structured concurrency** organizes asynchronous tasks into a predictable and hierarchical structure. Instead of launching asynchronous tasks without control, structured concurrency groups tasks, ensuring all child tasks finish before the parent completes.

#### Using Task Groups
**Task groups** allow parallel execution of tasks while keeping them under a single hierarchy. Task groups automatically wait for all tasks to complete before the parent function ends.

    func fetchAllData() async {
        await withTaskGroup(of: Data.self) { group in
            group.addTask { await fetchData1() }
            group.addTask { await fetchData2() }
        }
    }

In this example, `fetchAllData` waits until both `fetchData1` and `fetchData2` complete before continuing.

### Actors: Data Isolation in Concurrency

Actors provide **data isolation** for shared resources, protecting mutable state from concurrent access. With **actors**, Swift guarantees that only one task can access an actor’s mutable state at a time, reducing the likelihood of data races.

#### Defining an Actor

    actor BankAccount {
        private var balance: Int = 0
        
        func deposit(amount: Int) {
            balance += amount
        }
    }

In this example, `BankAccount` is an actor that ensures only one task can modify the balance at any time.

#### Accessing Actor Properties and Methods

Accessing actor properties and methods requires `await` since actor operations are asynchronous:

    let account = BankAccount()
    await account.deposit(amount: 100)

### Handling Async Tasks with Task and Task.detached

Swift provides `Task` and `Task.detached` for starting asynchronous work outside structured concurrency:

- **Task**: Adheres to structured concurrency.
- **Task.detached**: Runs independently and is useful for launching isolated work.

#### Example with Task.detached

    Task.detached {
        await performIndependentTask()
    }

Be cautious with detached tasks since they operate independently, without the safety of structured concurrency.

### Cancellation and Error Handling in Concurrency

Tasks can be canceled, and Swift’s concurrency model allows tasks to check for cancellation requests, improving performance by stopping unnecessary work.

#### Checking for Cancellation

    if Task.isCancelled {
        // Handle task cancellation
    }

#### Throwing Errors in Async Functions

Async functions can also throw errors, enabling error handling through `try`/`catch` blocks:

    func fetchUserData() async throws -> UserData {
        // Asynchronous operation that may throw an error
    }

    do {
        let userData = try await fetchUserData()
    } catch {
        print("Error fetching user data: \(error)")
    }

### Discussion on Swift Concurrency Model

The Swift concurrency model, with its async/await syntax and structured concurrency, simplifies asynchronous code and enhances readability. However, there are trade-offs to consider:

**Pros**:
- Async/await improves code readability and reduces callback hell.
- Structured concurrency ensures all tasks complete in an organized hierarchy.
- Actors help avoid data races by isolating shared mutable state.

**Cons**:
- Misusing `Task.detached` can lead to unstructured concurrency and potential bugs.
- Using async/await with actors can be challenging to integrate with existing synchronous codebases.

The concurrency model works best for new Swift projects and is optimized for safe, readable asynchronous programming.

=== Section: Key Takeaways ===
- **Async/await** provides a sequential way to write asynchronous code.
- **Structured concurrency** organizes tasks in a hierarchical structure, ensuring all tasks complete in an orderly fashion.
- **Actors** protect mutable state from concurrent access, reducing the risk of data races.
- Use `Task` for structured concurrency and `Task.detached` for isolated tasks.
- Always check for **Task.isCancelled** in long-running async tasks to handle cancellations.
