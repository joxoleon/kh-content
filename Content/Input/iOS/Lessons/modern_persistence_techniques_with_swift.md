# Modern Persistence Techniques with Swift

In this lesson, we will delve into **Modern Data Persistence Techniques** used in iOS development with **Swift**. Data persistence is crucial in applications, as it allows data to be saved between app launches. This lesson will focus on utilizing the **Codable** protocol for serialization, integrating it with **UserDefaults** and file storage, and introducing **Combine** for enhanced data handling. 

> **Codable** is a type alias for the `Encodable` and `Decodable` protocols, which provide a way to encode and decode data structures.

We will explore practical examples and best practices to ensure effective data management in your iOS applications.

# Modern Persistence Techniques with Swift

## Overview of Codable

The **Codable** protocol in Swift simplifies the process of encoding and decoding complex data types. By conforming to Codable, you can easily convert your data structures to and from formats like JSON or Property List.

### Example of a Codable Struct

Let's begin with a simple struct that conforms to Codable:

    struct User: Codable {
        var id: Int
        var name: String
        var email: String
    }

This struct can be easily encoded to JSON format and decoded back into a User object.

### Encoding and Decoding with JSONEncoder and JSONDecoder

To encode an instance of our User struct to JSON:

    let user = User(id: 1, name: "John Doe", email: "john.doe@example.com")
    let encoder = JSONEncoder()

    do {
        let jsonData = try encoder.encode(user)
        let jsonString = String(data: jsonData, encoding: .utf8)
        print(jsonString)  // Output: JSON representation of User
    } catch {
        print("Error encoding user: \(error)")
    }

To decode the JSON back into a User object:

    let json = """
    {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "John Doe",
        "email": "john.doe@example.com"
    }
    """
    let decoder = JSONDecoder()

    do {
        let jsonData = json.data(using: .utf8)!
        let decodedUser = try decoder.decode(User.self, from: jsonData)
        print(decodedUser)  // Output: User(id: 1, name: "John Doe", email: "john.doe@example.com")
    } catch {
        print("Error decoding user: \(error)")
    }

## Storing Data with UserDefaults

**UserDefaults** is a simple way to store small amounts of data persistently. It is best suited for lightweight data like user preferences or settings. However, it is not ideal for large datasets.

### Example of Storing and Retrieving Codable Data

You can store a Codable object in UserDefaults like this:

    let defaults = UserDefaults.standard

    do {
        let jsonData = try encoder.encode(user)
        defaults.set(jsonData, forKey: "currentUser")
    } catch {
        print("Error saving user to UserDefaults: \(error)")
    }

To retrieve the user:

    if let savedUserData = defaults.data(forKey: "currentUser") {
        do {
            let retrievedUser = try decoder.decode(User.self, from: savedUserData)
            print(retrievedUser)  // Output: User object
        } catch {
            print("Error retrieving user from UserDefaults: \(error)")
        }
    }

## File Storage for Larger Data Sets

When dealing with larger data sets, file storage is more appropriate. You can write and read data to/from the file system.

### Example of File Storage

To write a JSON file:

    let fileURL = FileManager.default.urls(for: .documentDirectory, in: .userDomainMask)[0].appendingPathComponent("user.json")

    do {
        let jsonData = try encoder.encode(user)
        try jsonData.write(to: fileURL)
    } catch {
        print("Error writing user to file: \(error)")
    }

To read from the file:

    do {
        let data = try Data(contentsOf: fileURL)
        let fileUser = try decoder.decode(User.self, from: data)
        print(fileUser)  // Output: User object from file
    } catch {
        print("Error reading user from file: \(error)")
    }

## Enhancing Data Handling with Combine

**Combine** is a powerful framework that allows you to handle asynchronous events and data streams. By combining Combine with our persistence methods, we can observe changes in our data.

### Example of Using Combine

You can create a publisher that emits updates when the user data changes:

    import Combine

    class UserManager: ObservableObject {
        @Published var currentUser: User?

        func fetchUser() {
            // Fetch user from UserDefaults or file
        }
    }

By using Combine, the UI can automatically update when the `currentUser` changes.

### Pros and Cons of Using Codable, UserDefaults, and File Storage

**Pros:**

- **Codable**: Simplifies JSON parsing, making the code more readable and maintainable.
- **UserDefaults**: Easy to use for storing small data; persists data across app launches.
- **File Storage**: Suitable for larger datasets, allowing for more complex data management.

**Cons:**

- **Codable**: Limited to data types that conform to Codable; requires careful management of data structures.
- **UserDefaults**: Not designed for large datasets, which can lead to performance issues.
- **File Storage**: Requires more code to manage file operations and error handling.

### Common Use Cases

- Use **Codable** for API responses and local data serialization.
- Use **UserDefaults** for user preferences, such as theme or settings.
- Use **File Storage** for saving files, such as user-generated content or large datasets.
