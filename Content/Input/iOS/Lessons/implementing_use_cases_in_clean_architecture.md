# Implementing Use Cases in Clean Architecture

In software engineering, particularly within **Clean Architecture**, the concept of **Use Cases** plays a pivotal role in structuring business logic. Use Cases act as a bridge between the user requirements and the underlying systems, encapsulating the operations that can be performed by the system. They define the interactions between actors (users or other systems) and the system itself, ensuring that the business rules and application behavior are clearly defined and isolated from external concerns. 

> Use Cases are essential as they encapsulate **business logic**, ensuring that the system remains adaptable to changing requirements without impacting its core functionality.

# Implementing Use Cases

## Understanding Use Cases

A **Use Case** represents a specific functionality or set of actions that a user can perform with an application. In Clean Architecture, Use Cases reside in the **Domain Layer**, which focuses on the application's core functionality, independent of external factors like databases, UI frameworks, or third-party services. This separation allows for a more maintainable and testable codebase.

### Structure of a Use Case

Typically, a Use Case will consist of:

- **Input Data**: Information needed to execute the Use Case.
- **Business Logic**: The rules that govern how the input data is processed.
- **Output Data**: The result of the Use Case execution.

### Example of a Use Case

Consider a simple Use Case for a banking application that allows users to transfer funds between accounts. This Use Case might be defined as follows:

```swift
struct TransferFundsUseCase {
    let accountRepository: AccountRepository

    func execute(from: Account, to: Account, amount: Double) throws {
        // Validate accounts and amount
        guard amount > 0 else {
            throw TransferError.invalidAmount
        }
        
        guard accountRepository.accountExists(account: from),
              accountRepository.accountExists(account: to) else {
            throw TransferError.accountNotFound
        }
        
        // Perform the transfer
        accountRepository.debit(account: from, amount: amount)
        accountRepository.credit(account: to, amount: amount)
    }
}
```

In this example, the `TransferFundsUseCase` interacts with an `AccountRepository` to manage accounts and execute the transfer logic. The Use Case is responsible for ensuring that the business rules (such as account validity and sufficient balance) are adhered to.

### Interaction with Repositories

The Use Case interacts with repositories to perform data operations. The repository pattern abstracts the data access layer, allowing the Use Case to focus solely on business logic without worrying about how data is retrieved or stored.

For instance, the `AccountRepository` can be defined as follows:

```swift
protocol AccountRepository {
    func accountExists(account: Account) -> Bool
    func debit(account: Account, amount: Double)
    func credit(account: Account, amount: Double)
}
```

This abstraction allows the Use Case to be tested in isolation by providing a mock implementation of the `AccountRepository`.

### Benefits of Using Use Cases

1. **Modularity**: Each Use Case encapsulates a specific functionality, making it easier to manage and modify.
2. **Testability**: Use Cases can be tested independently by mocking dependencies, ensuring that business logic is correct.
3. **Clarity**: By defining Use Cases, developers can clearly communicate the intended functionality of the application.

### Pros of Using Use Cases

- **Separation of Concerns**: Use Cases separate business logic from UI and data access concerns, leading to a cleaner architecture.
- **Easier Refactoring**: Changes in business logic can be made in one place without affecting other parts of the application.
- **Enhanced Collaboration**: Clearly defined Use Cases improve communication among stakeholders, including developers, product owners, and designers.

### Cons of Using Use Cases

- **Overhead**: For very simple applications, implementing Use Cases may introduce unnecessary complexity.
- **Learning Curve**: Developers unfamiliar with Clean Architecture may find it challenging to grasp the Use Case concept initially.

### Common Use Cases in iOS Development

In iOS development, common Use Cases might include:

- User authentication
- Data fetching and caching
- Form submissions and validations
- Payment processing

By focusing on these Use Cases, iOS developers can create robust applications that are easier to maintain and scale.
